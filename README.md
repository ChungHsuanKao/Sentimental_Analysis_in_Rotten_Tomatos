# Sentimental_Analysis_in_Rotten_Tomatos


I am curious to know wheather fresh or rotten tomatos can actually reflect reviews from critics. In the notebook, I tried to perform two different vectorizers: CountVectorizer() and TfidfVectorizer(). With the vectorized reviews from critics, I compared different modeling: Logistics and multinomial Naive Bays.

The practice so far gave me ~75% matching between tomato indicator and actual review.
